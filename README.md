# problemSolving_js

this repo contain simple problem and solve for it in Array topic.


Problems
---------
1- create a function that takes two arguments, one is an array and the other is a number, then return the index of the given value or return -1 if the element cannot be found.

2- create a function that takes an array of integers between 1 and 100 except for one, and returns the missing number.

3- create a function that takes an array of integers and returns a new array with the same integers without the duplicates 

4- create a function that takes an array of integers and returns the average of all the numbers in it 

5- Write a function that, takes an array of integers as input, iterates over the array, and returns a new array.
 The returned array should contain the result of raising 2 to the power of the original input element.
For example,([1,2,3]) returns [2,4,8] because 2 ^ 1 = 2, 2 ^ 2 = 4, and 2 ^ 3 = 8.
Use for and forEach and then map to solve this question to see the difference between the three ways 

6- Write a function that, takes an array of numbers as input, uses map to return a new array where each element is either the string "even" or the string "odd", based on each value.
If any element in the array is not a number, the resulting array should have the string "N/A" in its place.
For example:([1,2,3,"Rawan"]) returns ['odd','even','odd','N/A'].

7- Write a function named fizzbuzz that takes in an array of numbers.
Iterate over the array using forEach or map to determine the output based on several rules:
  - If a number is divisible by 3, add the word "Fizz" to the output array.
  - If the number is divisible by 5, add the word "Buzz" to the output array.
  - If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, add the phrase "Fizz Buzz" to the output array.
  - Otherwise, add the number to the output array.
Return the resulting output array.
